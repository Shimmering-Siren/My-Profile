## Efua Osagiede
### Bio
"My name is Efua Osagiede. I'm 11, turning 12 soon, and I'm from Nigeria's Esan tribe with a dark complexion. I have a few core interests: I prefer black and dark colors, my favorite food is spicy noodles, and I love playing Roblox. Another activity I really enjoy is swimming, although I'm still learning. When I'm relaxing, I like watching YouTube, especially comedy videos because I find them funny and interesting. Socially, I have a small circle of friends that I can really trust, and I share my Roblox fun with them and my siblings. People often find me funny too; I love to laugh and enjoy making jokes."
